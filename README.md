what you want to do is click on the top button this will open the create a world menu. After that you'll need to click on the button that says survival and keep doing that until it says creative. Then click create new world and wait to load in. On entery you'll have to move and clicking W will let you move forward. If you hold W you'll move more smoothely. If you move your mouse left and right you can look left and right. Next pressthe button E to open up your inventory here you can get blocks and put them in your hotbar. If you press E again you can exit your inventory. Now use the scrole weel on your mouse to change the slot you are on in your hot bar. Then once your on the block you got, press the right button on your mouse to plase the block in your hand. To break the block press the left button on the mouse. now comes the most important part goof off. I know it sounds random but it really helps just to do anything thats creative. I mean it's caled Creative mode i am a nerd helicopter helicopter..
